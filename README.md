# acmsocc.github.io
Top-level web pages for http://acmsocc.github.io/.

These provide links to the individual SoCC events, and overview material (e.g., instructions for contributors).

FYI: ACM currently owns the domain acmsocc.org (and a bunch of others ending in .net, .com, .info). We got the .org domain to point to Github page via CNAME and A record changes. If you need any more DNS changes you can also send a message to ishelpdesk@acm.org. This mailbox is monitored and someone will be able to make any changes needed.
